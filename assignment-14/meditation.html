            <h2> Alice Rubert</h2>
          <p> Alice Rubert grew up in the quaint town of Elk Rapids, Michigan and has planted her roots
establishing Northern Michigan as her home for over 20 years. She obtained her realtors license
in 2012 and swiftly realized how rewarding it felt to help clients build their foundation while
planting their own physical roots in this beautiful area. </p>
<p>With over ten years in the real estate business, helping others with their real estate needs, Alice
experienced burnout, depriving herself of the adequate love and attention she needed to thrive.
Upon the realization and awareness, the Universe provided a mandatory pause with the COVID
19 Pandemic. This pause allowed her to reconnect deeply with her inner highest self and assisted
her with a plan for showing up, resulting in her finding her purpose.</p>
<p>After a deep soul-search and necessary research, Alice enrolled in a health coaching program
through the renowned Chopra Center based in California where she learned about the ancient
healing science-Ayurveda and the life-changing tool and practice of Meditation. Alice is certified
in Primordial Sound Meditation; a healing practice that allows us to experience a common deep
relaxation.</p>
<p>She slowly began to realize this mindfulness practice in her life had the most enormous impact.
Meditation has been such an essential tool that has helped with her social anxiety, depression,
mood, patience, and her overall Being. She had a certainty from deep down, to help others build
a strong foundation within themselves and plant meaningful roots of a whole different kind.
Her mission is to guide people to a place where they can experience a fullness and wholeness of
who they are. Alice finds the group meditation sessions to be special as she knows deep within, a
true sense of connection with ourselves, others, animals, nature, and with source or the divine, is
what brings meaning to our lives. Experiencing meditation can allow you not only to connect
with your highest and best self, but also to connect with other people who too, are present to
experience the same feeling of connection in Being.Â </P>
<p>When Alice is not helping others reconnect through her meditation practice, she enjoys spending
quality time exploring nature with her husband Eric, dog and her kids Lila and Emery. She also
enjoys traveling and bonding with friends and family. </p>
