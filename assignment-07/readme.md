In my internet browsing, I've come across many files. I'd say the file I encounter the most often is a subscription sign up file. These are usually on a site that offers a product or service. I've found the most appealing subscription forms entice you to sign up (usually for an email list) by offering a discount or using a catchy tagline such as "don't miss out on future sales" that makes you more inclined to put in your email. These are of benefit to the business because it gives them more outreach to their customers as they have an easy way to communicate en masse.
